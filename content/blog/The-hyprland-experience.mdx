# Background

I've been a Ubuntu + GNOME user since 2021, when I was in 11th grade. I got a laptop to prepare for JEE (since COVID and lockdown stuff was going on, my parents thought preparing online would be better). Fast forward about four months, I started playing <H>**Valorant**</H>. I was kinda addicted to it and didn’t really study much.

That’s when my journey with Linux began. I had heard about Linux from a few places - like it's some high-end operating system only software engineers use, blah blah. I found out that Linux doesn’t support games like Valorant because those games install a security system into the kernel. So, I decided to install Linux to force myself to study rather than play Valorant all day.

Now comes the big question.

### Which Linux distro to use

Searched `the best linux distro out there` on google, got some big names - `ubuntu`, `linux mint`, `pop os`,
`fedora` and some more, and being the smartest man alive i decided to go with ubuntu beacause its the first option i am being served. 

# Ubuntu

Flashed a usb stick with ubuntu and installed it fresh on my laptop (not dual boot, removed window :clown:). Ubuntu comes with gnome by default.

### What is gnome

Google says

`GNOME is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface and a set of applications for interacting with the operating system, making it easier for users, especially those less familiar with command-line interfaces, to use Linux.` 

It’s basically the UI/UX layer that sits on top of your operating system and makes it usable — like the Start menu, taskbar, file manager, system settings, and how your windows look and behave.

If linux is the engine, gnome (or hyprland) is the steering wheel.

### Pros of gnome

- <H>pre-installed with ubuntu, no need to setup anything.</H>
- <H>clean and minimal UI, feels like windows but from meesho.</H>
- <H>app ecosystem, gnome comes with out of the box apps like calendar, terminal, software store.</H>
- <H>customising gnome is easy, download some theme, icon-pack from <a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/" className="underline">here</a> and use it using the gnome-tweaks. </H>


### Cons of gnome

- <H>customisation is easy but very limited, moving the dock was almost imposibble for me at some time.</H>
- <H>deprecated extensions, most of the good extensions are deprecated and not supported with the latest version.</H>


I was kinda happy with this setup. it was smooth, fast, used to look great (i dont have any screenshot of that), it used to look like a top bar with workspace menu on left, clock and media in center, internet speed, and dashboard on the right, a floating dock at the bottom of the screen exactly like the macOs one.
